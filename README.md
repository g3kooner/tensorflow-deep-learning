# tensorflow-deep-learning

Notebook repository to display deep learning models i've build/tuned using Tensorflow and Keras to accomplish various computer vision tasks. All the documentation and code is available within the notebook files, but I suggest using the Google Colab links to quickly compile, fit and analyze the model's performance. <br/><br/>

Semantic Image Segmentation - 
Reconstruct the fully convolutional UNet model to predict segmentation masks for data available in the Oxford-IIT dataset. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pSDeBnsG4YP-6OaSzjix6HRG_rj3Spob" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg/" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> <br/><br/>

Neural Style Transfer - Building a convolutional neural network (VGG-19) to extract style and content properties from one image, and apply them to another. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XLb6h0k3tJVo_9DUlsHHkYRrzzw9Z9OL" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg/" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> <br/><br/>

Object Detection - Fine tune, customize, and retrain the RetinaNet model to perform object detection against images with just five training examples. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OX77NrM0a0Mrl67TI41uiTAFcQRlbWeJ" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg/" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
